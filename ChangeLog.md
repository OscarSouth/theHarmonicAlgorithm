# Changelog for theHarmonicAlgorithm

## Version 1.0.1.1

More intelligent naming logic with regard to slash chord notation.
Removed some system specific path dependencies

## Version 1.0.1.0

Version 1.0.1.0 makes a few refinements to the codebase as well as introducing
a new feature -- Random Sequences!

Random sequences allow the performer/composer to traverse deterministic space 
(move through musical cadences!) at a much faster rate and give a 'higher up' 
viewpoint to the character and nature of harmonic motion in a given musical 
context. The performer/composer can then 'jump in' to any point of the
generated sequence and move through musical space in 'blocks' of harmony.

## Version 1.0.0.0 is complete!

The Harmonic Algorithm 1.0.0.0 implements a generation, filtering and 
exploration algorithm for triadic musical data, with a focus on composing
with the overtones of an instrument and scope for use in traditional 
composition, instrumental study or even live performance.

This functionality is augmented by a conceptually complete Markov Chain 
Machine Learning implementation, trained on Bach Chorale harmonisation data 
retrieved from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Dua, D., Karra Taniskidou, 
E., 2017 http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml). 

In version 1.0.0.0 of The Harmonic Algorithm, a command line interface is
provided for interaction with the underlying musical and numerical algorithms.
